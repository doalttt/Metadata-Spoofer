# What does this do???:
It searches for a string and replaces the hex value to 00 (deleting it entirely).
the game will no longer be able to call the method, therefore **removing it entirely**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Anything Else?:
+ There is a built in word searcher and a option to remove the words that you have searched or not (Y/N).
+ For rec room users theres a prefab finder to find prefabs to swap ingame.
+ Theres stuff for gorilla tag fangames and shooter games
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Dont get your hopes up to high, this tool is VERY Limited to what it can do.**
